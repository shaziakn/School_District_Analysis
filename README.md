# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
A school district needs an analysis to present to the school board on anonymized student standardized testing performance and student funding. Deliverables:

1. A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
2. An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
3. Tables presenting each of the following metrics:  
    a. Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate   
    b. The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school   
    c. The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school   
    d. School performance based on the budget per student  
    e. School performance based on the school size   
    f. School performance based on the type of school   

## Resources
- Data Sources: students_complete.csv, schools_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Jupyter Notebook

## Summary 
- As a whole, schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. By contrast, schools with higher spending 645-675 per student actually underperformed compared to schools with smaller budgets (585 per student).

- As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).

- As a whole, charter schools out-performed the public district schools across all metrics. However, more analysis will be required to glean if the effect is due to school practices or the fact that charter schools tend to serve smaller student populations per school.
